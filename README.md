# Data-Structures-2
Implementations of some exotic data structures.

I am currently taking a "Data Structures 2" course at the university.<br/>
We will have a bunch of homeworks and a project. So the purpose of this repo is to store them. <br/>

I have not decided if I am going to use Java ot C++.<br/>
I feel more comfortable with Java, but I desire to learn C++ and I believe implementing all these data structures will be a very good experience. SO, I'm starting with C++ and we'll see how it goes...

Treap - this is a hybrid between Binary Search Tree and Heap. Every node holds some key and priority value, which is randomly generated number. The treap arranges its elements like BST by their key value and like Heap by the priority. The idea is to keep it somehow balanced.

Day-Stout-Warren algorithm - This algorithm is used to make from normal Binary Tree -> complete Binary Tree.<br/>
