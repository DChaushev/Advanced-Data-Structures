# Data-Structures-2
Implementations of some exotic data structures.

I am currently taking a "Data Structures 2" course at the university.<br/>
We will have a bunch of homeworks and a project. So the purpose of this repo is to store them. <br/>

I have not decided if I am going to use Java ot C++.<br/>
I feel more comfortable with Java, but I desire to learn C++ and I believe implementing all these data structures will be a very good experience. SO, I'm starting with C++ and we'll see how it goes...
